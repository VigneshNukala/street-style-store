Street Style Store Assignment - Project Report

Introduction:
The Street Style Store Assignment is a backend implementation that provides CRUD operations and 
authentication using Node.js, Express, and SQLite. The goal of this project is to create a secure and 
efficient API that allows users to register, log in, and manage items through various API endpoints.

Approach and Implementation:
The project follows a structured approach to backend development, ensuring scalability, security, and 
maintainability. The key implementations include:

- Authentication: Implemented JWT-based authentication for secure user login and data protection.
- Database Management: Used SQLite for local development, with an option to switch to PostgreSQL or 
                       MySQL for production scalability.
- API Design: Created RESTful API endpoints to handle user authentication and item management.
- Security Measures: Implemented rate limiting and standardized error responses for better API 
                     reliability and security.
- Middleware: Used Express middleware for request parsing, authentication, and error handling.

Challenges Faced and Solutions Implemented
- JWT Token Handling Issue :
  - Challenge: Encountered issues with malformed JWT tokens leading to authentication failures.
  - Solution: Added validation checks before decoding JWT and ensured the secret key is correctly 
    configured in environment variables.

- Database Connection Issues :
  - Challenge: The database connection was initially required to be explicitly called before executing
               queries.
  - Solution: Modified the database handler to initialize automatically when needed, removing the need
              for manual connection calls.

- Handling Cookies in Requests :
  - Challenge: req.cookies.token was returning undefined due to missing cookie-parser configuration.
  - Solution: Implemented `cookie-parser` middleware and ensured that the frontend includes credentials 
              in fetch requests.

Key Features :
- User Registration & Login : Secure JWT-based authentication.
- CRUD Operations on Items : Users can create, retrieve, update, and delete items.
- Token-based Authorization : Ensures that only authenticated users can perform actions.
- Database Schema : Defined structured tables for users and items with auto-generated timestamps.

Conclusion :
The project successfully implements a robust backend system with authentication and CRUD functionality. 
Key challenges related to authentication, database handling, and security were effectively addressed. 
Future improvements could include integrating a frontend UI, switching to a production-ready database, 
and adding role-based access control.
